				<p> Dr. Kalam, when you became the President, you gave the word ‘hope’ a new meaning for Indians. Today, we have
					lost a great leader who inspired our young minds to feel that we live in the greatest nation on earth and that
					each one of them can achieve great things. May the creator lead you to heaven.
